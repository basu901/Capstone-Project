The Application queries the NutritionixAPI: https://www.nutritionix.com/ , and an account needs to be created, after which the two
keys, app_id and app_key can be generated from https://developer.nutritionix.com/docs/v1_1.

Place the two keys in the app's build.gradle file in the respective fields named as APP_ID and APP_KEY.
